# HitSpan

HitSpan is a lightweight, client-side HUD mod for Minecraft 1.8.9 that displays:

- **Hit range**, calculated using Minecraft’s own ray + hitbox logic
- **Knockback distance**, measured over multiple ticks after a confirmed hit

The goal of the mod is to stay simple, accurate, and multiplayer-safe.

## Features
- Accurate hit range calculation
- Real knockback tracking over several ticks
- Separate HUD elements for range and knockback
- Draggable HUDs via OneConfig
- Fully client-side
- Safe for multiplayer and modpacks

## Current Status
This is **v1.2**, and it is intentionally minimal.

A configuration menu is available via **OneConfig**, allowing:
- HUD positioning and visibility
- HUD decay/reset timing
- Players-only mode

More configuration options may be added in the future.

## Compatibility
- Minecraft **1.8.9**
- Forge **11.15.1.2318**
- Client-side only

## Installation
1. Install Minecraft Forge for 1.8.9
